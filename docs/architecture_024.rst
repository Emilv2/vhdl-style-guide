################

This rule checks for the architecture name in the *end architecture* statement.
It is clearer to the reader to state which architecture the end statement is closing.

**Violation**

.. code-block:: vhdl

   end architecture;

**Fix**

.. code-block:: vhdl

   end architecture ARCHITECTURE_NAME;
