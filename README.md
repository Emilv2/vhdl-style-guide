Style guide enforcement for VHDL

After recently performing code reviews for some VHDL, there were quite a few style issues.
I believe these issues distracted from the true purpose of the code review.

We typically use Spyglass as a static analyzer, but it does not cover all the style issues I am interested in.

Therefore, I am writing VSG to help with future code reviews.

## Language

I have choosen to implement the program in Python so I can further my learning of the language.
